# Swizzle & Salud: Your Mocktail Mixology Mainstay

*The recipe hub for the social enthusiast who loves their tonic... hold the gin.*

### Application Overview

Welcome to Swizzle and Salud, a social recipe application for discerning palates who want all spirit, no spirits.

The list of cocktail websites is long, but finding non-alcoholic proxies can be tough, as alcohol’s more sober cousins often succumb to one of a few common pitfalls: when they aren’t a total sugar bomb, they are often hidden on other recipe sites and blogs alongside alcohol promotion, which can be triggering for those in recovery. Swizzle & Salud is a site dedicated to drink aficionados who want to explore all things mixology in one place. 

The initial build of this application was completed in two weeks, using React and CSS for styling. My goals were to incorporate full CRUD functionality, engage many-to-many relationships, and work wih conditionality to render different views.
